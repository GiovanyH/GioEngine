#### GioEngine

<sub> I will be using some features of other people's codes, like the Dear ImGui from ocornut, which stands out since all of the GUI will be using it

<sub> And the repository and LICENSE for them will always be somewhere in my code

The general goal of this is to make a game engine that is free and open source, the editor written in C / C++ and the engine's internal API written in C / C++ and Rust as the frontend (that is going to be used by the engine's editor), the text-editor have some of the Vim key bindings and those have to combine with a canvas that together make up the Engine.  
The Engine may be bigger and have more features in the future, but the central idea still the same.
