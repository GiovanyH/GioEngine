<sub> I will be using some features of other people's codes, like the Dear ImGui from ocornut, which stands out since all of the GUI will be using it

The general goal of this is to make a game engine that is free and open source, the editor written in C / C++ and the engine's internal API written in C / C++ and Rust as the frontend (that is going to be used by the engine's editor), the text-editor have some of the Vim key bindings and those have to combine with a canvas that together make up the Engine.  
The Engine may be bigger and have more features in the future, but the central idea still the same.

----
